## Run the app

You must have installed Nodejs and npm first, then in the project directory run:

### `npm install`

After that run:

### `npm run start:dev`  

or in pre-production mode:

### `npm run start:preprod`  


## Configure the backend

The base URL targets to  `http://localhost:3000/v1`,
If you want to change that go to:

### `../src/config/index.js` and change `BASE_API`
